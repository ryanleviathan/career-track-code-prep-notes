Objects
  1) Basics
	Honestly these TDD bin code challenge things make very little sense to me. Looks like the first explores obj literal shorthand techniques of which we've been practicing this week!
  2) Computed Properties
	Obj literal properties can be computed values and functions and function calls! That's pretty cool. It was difficult to manipulate the code base, but it does some cool stuff!
Classes
  1) Creation
	You can create a class that can create objects with the same keys and different values. 
  2) Statics
	Creates a static value in the class.
  3) Extends
	Extends creates a child class of another class.
Destructuring
  1) Array Destructuring
	Allows you to make the code shorter. You can swap variables, use leading commas to change output from an array, and other things.
  2) String Destructuring
	coolest thing here for me is taking a string and 1 line destrute it to individual values in an array. So much data manipulation in such little time.
  3) Object Destructuring
	So much destructing can happen with similar syntax. Destructuring from arrays in objects and objects in arrays has been going well.
  4) Destructuring with Defaults
	You can assign default values and manipulate where the value goes inside objects and arrays.
  5) Destructuring Function Parameters
	You can destructure multiple params in objs and arrays, along with adding defaults.
  6) Destructuring with Alias
	You can rename, assign properties new or default values while destructuring.
Rest
  1) Rest as param
	Allows you easy access to particular indexs of arrays.
  2) Rest while destructuring
	Allows you to destructure while naming/assigning the rest of the array to a variable.
Spread
  1) Array spread
	Spread seems really similar to Rest for me. Spread has a bit more application to it, in that you can use it wherever you'd like in an array.
Function Defaults
  1) Function Defaults
	Function default params gives you a much more flexible function. You can use it to give a default if it's undefined and that default can be ignored if a value is given.
